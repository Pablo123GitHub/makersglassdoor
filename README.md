# Makersglassdoor

### Goal

This project is a collective effort of 5 alumni from Makers Academy as we want to put into practice our knowledge of Agile methodologies and XP values.

### What we are building
We want to make an app that allows Makers alumni to give feedback about their experience once hired. It would give students/job_hunters  more insights into what is required to be a successful applicant or what technical stack they should be focussing on once they finish the course. Please note that this is work in progress.
